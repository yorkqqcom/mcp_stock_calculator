ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'server'

_**Assistant**_

The error message:

```
ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'server'
```

means that in your `mcp_stock_calculator/__init__.py` file, you have:

```python
from server import run as mcp_run
```

But Python cannot find a module named `server` in the current import path. This usually happens because:

1. The import should be relative (i.e., `from .server import run as mcp_run`) since `server.py` is in the same package directory as `__init__.py`.
2. Or, you are running the module in a way that doesn't set up the package context correctly.

**How to fix:**

Open `mcp_stock_calculator/__init__.py` and change:

```python
from server import run as mcp_run
```

to:

```python
from .server import run as mcp_run
```

This tells Python to import `server` from the same package directory.

Would you like me to make this change for you?

D:\PycharmProjects\mcp_stock_calculator\.venv\Scripts\python.exe: No module named mcp_stock_calculator.__main__; 'mcp_stock_calculator' is a package and cannot be directly executed


---

_**Assistant**_

This error:

```
No module named mcp_stock_calculator.__main__; 'mcp_stock_calculator' is a package and cannot be directly executed
```

means you tried to run the package as a script, but there is no `__main__.py` file in the `mcp_stock_calculator` package directory.

### What does this mean?

- When you run `python -m mcp_stock_calculator`, Python looks for `mcp_stock_calculator/__main__.py` to execute.
- If it doesn't exist, you get this error.

### How to fix

**Option 1: Add a `__main__.py` file**

Create a file named `__main__.py` inside the `mcp_stock_calculator` directory. This file should contain the code you want to run when the package is executed as a module.

For example, you can make it run your main logic:

```python
from .main import main

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

Or, if your entry point is in `server.py`:

```python
from .server import run

if __name__ == "__main__":
    run()
```

**Option 2: Run a specific script directly**

Instead of running the package, run the script you want directly, e.g.:

```sh
python mcp_stock_calculator/main.py
```
or
```sh
python mcp_stock_calculator/server.py
```

---

Would you like me to create a `__main__.py` file for you, and if so, should it run `main.py` or `server.py`?
